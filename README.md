# YxWn-Gallery
YxWn-Gallery is a minimalist desktop application for viewing and displaying media file folders easily and interestingly. 
It displays random media files from the folder that you selected. 
It is similar to a digital photo frame, but omits all the bloat features and UI elements that I deemed unecessary in third party software and hardware offerings and includes additional advanced functionalities tailored to my own file management ecosystem. 
One of the most unique features of the app is that it can be set as the desktop wallpaper of the computer. 

It is an app built for me and my very close friend to reminiscence our dear memories easily. 
Elements that represent our bond can be seen from every little corner of the application. 
I personally use the app daily as part of my routine to revisit the pictures, videos, and screenshots that I have taken on the same day in previous years. 
Moreover, it runs on my laptop 24/7 and shows me the pictures, videos, and screenshots that I have taken and stored in my laptop recently. 
It is a very important piece of software in my life.

Feel to to try it out, share it with others, and let me know if the app personally helped you in any way!

## Trivia
- The app icon is a fan drawing of Terriermon from Digimon!
  It was drawn by my close friend Winnie!
  I love it very much! (⁠｡⁠ﾉ⁠ω⁠＼⁠｡⁠)
- The background of the app is filled with the drawing of Shiro and Nana from the movie "Crayon Shin-chan the Movie: Our Dinosaur Diary", which was also drawn by Winnie!
  Shiro and Nana each represent one of us. Watching this movie was the last activity we did together before we ended our university days.
  It carries heavy meaning for our relationship. (⁠´⁠；⁠ω⁠；⁠｀⁠)
- The pixel art of the playback buttons are drawn by me! Pixel art is another connection that me and Winnie shared! (⁠*⁠´⁠ω⁠｀⁠ *⁠)
