# YxWn-Gallery
YxWn-Gallery is a minimalist desktop application for easily viewing and displaying media collection with an element of surprise.. 
Its design and functionalities are similar to digital photo frames, but omits all the bloat features and UI elements that I deemed unecessary in third party software and hardware offerings. 

It can be set as the desktop wallpaper of the computer. 

It is an app built for me and my very close friend to reminiscence our dear memories with ease, as can be seen from many elements in the application. 
I personally use the app every day as part of my daily routine to revisit the pictures, videos, and screenshots that I have taken on the same day in previous years. 
Moreover, it runs on my laptop 24/7 and shows me the pictures, videos, and screenshots that I have taken and stored in my laptop recently. 

## Installation
### Method 1: Build from Source


### Method 2: Use Pre-Built Executable

## Usage

```python
import foobar
```

## Cool Tidbits
- The app icon is the drawing of Terriermon from Digimon. It was drawn by my close friend Winnie!
- The background image of the app contains Shiro and Nana from the movie "Crayon Shin-chan the Movie: Our Dinosaur Diary". It was drawn by my close friend Winnie too!
  They represent the both of us and is a huge memorial imagery of our friendship, the day we were no longer able to see each other daily anymore.
