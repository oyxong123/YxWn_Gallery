# YxWn-Gallery
YxWn-Gallery is a 


It is an app built for me and my close friend to reminiscence our dear memories easily, as can be shown from the components that exist in the app. 

## Installation
### Method 1: Build from Source


### Method 2: Use Pre-Built Executable

## Usage

```python
import foobar
```

## Cool Tidbits
- The app icon is the drawing of Terriermon from Digimon. It was drawn by my close friend Winnie!
- The background image of the app contains Shiro and Nana from the movie "Crayon Shin-chan the Movie: Our Dinosaur Diary". It was drawn by my close friend Winnie too!
  They represent the both of us and is a huge memorial imagery of our friendship, the day we were no longer able to see each other daily anymore.
